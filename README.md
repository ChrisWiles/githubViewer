# Github Viewer

#### Requires Early Access to use GitHub’s GraphQL
[Early Access](https://developer.github.com/early-access/)

Uses Apollo to connect the client with GitHub’s GraphQL. The queries are saved into the redux store and the UI is rendered with React and Material UI components.

See Live [Github Viewer](https://chriswiles.github.io/githubViewer)


## User Story

* Users should be able to type a github login and get a list of repositories

* Select a repo to see info and commit history

* Each of the commits should display the author’s name and the commit message as well as how long ago it occurred

* Clicking the author’s name should go to a separate page that displays the authors info

## Tech

- [Apollo Client](http://docs.apollostack.com/apollo-client/) - A simple caching client for any GraphQL server and UI framework built on top of Redux
- [GitHub GraphQL API](https://developer.github.com/early-access/graphql/) - API documentation
- [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) - GraphQL is a new way to think about building and querying APIs. Rather than construct several REST requests to fetch data that you're interested in, you can often make a single call to fetch the information you need.
- [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) - Google's material design UI components built with React.
- [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/docs) - React Router is a complete routing library for React. React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL
- [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) - Open-source JavaScript library providing a view for data rendered as HTML
- [Redux-Thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk) - The easiest way to write async action creators
- [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - Predictable state container for JavaScript apps
- [moment](http://momentjs.com/) - Parse, validate, manipulate, and display dates in JavaScript.

## Installation

Requires [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v6+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
## ToDo
* Add Pagination
