# Github Viewer

A React/Redux UI consuming the GitHub GraphQL API

See Live [Github Viewer](https://github--viewer.herokuapp.com/)


## User Story

* Users should be able to type a github login and get a list of repositories

* Select a repo to see info and commit history

* Each of the commits should display the author’s name and the commit message as well as how long ago it occurred

* Clicking the author’s name should go to a separate page that displays the authors info
