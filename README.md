See Live [Reddit Viewer](https://slider-puzzle.herokuapp.com/)

## Tech

* [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/getting-started.html) - Open-source JavaScript library providing a view for data rendered as HTML
* [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux) - Predictable state container for JavaScript apps
* [React Router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/tree/master/docs) - React Router is a complete routing library for React. React Router keeps your UI in sync with the URL
* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) - Api Documentation
* [Heroku](https://devcenter.heroku.com/categories/reference) - Create, deploy, and manage apps in the cloud
* [Material UI](http://www.material-ui.com/) - Google's material design UI components built with React.
* [graphqlhub](https://www.graphqlhub.com/) - Query popular APIs using GraphQL in your browser
* [GraphQLSchema](https://www.npmjs.com/package/graphql-schema) - Create GraphQL schemas with a fluent/chainable interface
* [Reddit API](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api/) - Reddit
If the user leaves the application and returns later they should be able to see the see were they last were at

* use [graphqlhub](https://www.graphqlhub.com/) and [apollo](http://docs.apollostack.com/apollo-client/) to query the Github api and populate data.
